# Problem Statement 

- We need to estimate accurately the time it takes to deliver the order to the customer.
- We have data of nearly 2 Lakh orders with ~15 features that might affect the delivery time.
- We will be building regression models for prediction of delivery time.

# Insights

- We have 2 Lakh orders with an average delivery time of 37 minutes.
- RF gave a MSE of 202.66 and R2 score of 0.19
- NN gave a MSE of 192.77 and R2 score of 0.23
- NN is better able to predict the delivery time as compared to RF on the test data.
